        <p>The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics hosts the <a href="https://www.aiaa.org/dbf">Design/Build/Fly competition</a> where dozens of university teams compete to perform
            missions with radio-controlled aircraft. During my first year at Columbia University in 2023, our club attended competition for the first time in eight years.
            Our first year was filled with many great teaching moments as we learned how to navigate the competition despite some flaws in our airplane's 
            design that prevented us from having a successful flight. I facilitated our team's growth from these mistakes through my leadership as the Chief Design Engineer in 2024.

        <p>
            Our team employs an iterative design process featuring rapid prototyping that allows us to quickly adapt to data collected from simulation and testing.
            In 2024, we adopted many new testing procedures to speed the development of our aircraft. This included load, shock, and vibrational testing on the component level,
            wind tunnel models for aerodynamic analysis, and full integration testing prior to our first flight.

        <p>
        As the 2024 Chief Design Engineer, I especially focused on the design process, implementing parametric modeling, rigorous Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T), 
        and practical simulations with FEA and CFD.

        <p>
            An example of a unique challenge in 2024 was the requirement that the plane take off within a very restricting 20 feet. We optimized the motor performance and lift characteristics of the wing 
            to successfully meet this challenge.

            These changes to our design processes led to our first successful flights at Design/Build/Fly, and our team's best placement in 10 years. 
            This year's competition remains promising for our team with our design proposal scoring in the top 10% of submissions.

        <p>   
            While I enjoy working in aeronautics and astronautics equally, a key reason I chose to dedicate time to serving as a leader in our Airplane Club was the amazing, close-knit group of students. 
            Our small team of around 15 members has allowed me to gain experience with every aspect of the project, providing moments of learning that I truly value as I enter my professional career. 
            My experience on the <a href="csi.html">rocketry team</a> has been similarly valuable, allowing me to contribute to the airframe through collaboration with others.
